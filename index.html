            <p class="mt-25p">Restructuring your obligations is a critical aspect to attracting and securing additional or new debt or equity investment. Approaching the capital markets with a dramatically improved balance sheet leads to far better terms, faster closing and lower costs. Facing the capital markets before your obligations are restructured places you at a tremendous disadvantage and potentially, failure in attracting any financial support. There is always the “Distressed” debt and equity markets available, however, any last resort scenarios are never ideal.</p>

            <p class="mt-25p">For the shareholder(s), Entrepreneur, Private Equity or Conglomerate, selling an enterprise or business unit with a restructured balance sheet will always lead to the best result. You can look forward to higher valuations, tighter reps and warranties, quicker due diligence and a faster closing. Management can focus on the sale process and not survival issues which strengthens the process.  </p>
