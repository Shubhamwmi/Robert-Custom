                <p class="mt-25p">Restructuring your obligations is a critical aspect to attracting and securing
                    additional
                    or new debt or equity investment. Approaching the capital markets with a dramatically improved
                    balance
                    sheet leads to far better terms, faster closing and lower costs. Facing the capital markets before
                    your
                    obligations are restructured places you at a tremendous disadvantage and potentially, failure in
                    attracting any financial support. There is always the “Distressed” debt and equity markets
                    available,
                    however, any last resort scenarios are never ideal.</p>

                <p class="mt-25p">For the shareholder(s), Entrepreneur, Private Equity or Conglomerate, selling an
                    enterprise or business unit with a restructured balance sheet will always lead to the best result.
                    You
                    can look forward to higher valuations, tighter reps and warranties, quicker due diligence and a
                    faster
                    closing. Management can focus on the sale process and not survival issues which strengthens the
                    process.

                        <p class="mt-25p">A master franchisor of a well known industrial apparel retail chain consisting
                            of
                            over 500 locations had a number of franchises that were suffering or failing. It was common
                            for
                            five to ten locations to be in distress each year mostly due to management failure. These
                            locations were selected properly, the demographics were in their favor and all analysis
                            suggested the troubled stores should be successful but they were not. In most cases the
                            operator
                            accumulated significant liabilities and it was beyond their ability to solve the problem
                            alone.
                            The operator was usually looking to sell in hopes of recovering their investment. However,
                            inventories were not current and seriously over stocked. Obligations to suppliers were
                            dramatically in arrears and in many cases the location lease was in jeopardy from being
                            unable
                            to pay their rent</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="secodline">
                        <p>The franchisor needed discreet intervention and an arms length approach which we were able to
                            provide. The operator wanted out and to salvage something. No one wanted failure, litigation
                            or
                            public embarrassment.
                            <br><br> We signed a network wide arrangement to address all problem locations as they
                            occurred.
                            We structured unique deep-discount arrangements with all apparel manufactures to eliminate
                            the
                            payable overhang. Using the excess and bloated inventories the operator liquidated
                            noncurrent
                            stock generating sufficient capital to retire the discounted debts. It was critical to also
                            renegotiate the location leasing agreement to reduce the cost of the operations. The
                            individual
                            balance sheet and operating costs were now in a position allowing the franchisor to offer
                            the
                            location to another existing operator in the chain or to a new incoming franchisee.

                                uncomfortable negotiations with their supply chain. The quasi arms length arrangement
                                created discretion.
                                <br><br>The operator was able to recover some value, protect their personal reputation
                                and
                                move out of a failing business efficiently and quickly.

                        <p class="mt-25p">Through a series of ownership changes and market issues a well known schedule
                            “A”
                            bank ended up the owner of a popular hotel and wellness property. Located in a national park
                            the
                            federal government was the land owner and lessor to the bank. The bank had hired a number of
                            hot
                            shot managers over a period of time with little success in managing the resort properly. In
                            the
                            midst of these management struggles a serious storm hit the whole region. Then lighting
                            struck,
                            literally. It knocked out the resorts control systems which in-turn damaged the main water
                            supply check valve above the property. This immediately caused flooding on every floor and
                            all
                            guests had to be evacuated. The flooding persisted and began to erode portions of the resort
                            and
                            potentially causing a major landslide aimed towards a national highway and village.

                    <div class="secodline">
                        <p>We were already well known by the bank that owned the resort from other significant mandates
                            they
                            had hired us for. We received their emergency call asking us to come in. We quickly
                            contacted
                            our relationships within the construction industry and organized teams to take control.
                            After
                            working through the night, our contractors were able to repair the water main and stop the
                            flooding. On day 2 it was time for us to take control of all the other issues on behalf of
                            the
                            bank. Top to bottom restoration was required. Our immediate focus was processing the
                            insurance
                            claims and making sure the environmental authorities were satisfied. The federal government
                            was
                            keenly involved and they needed to agree too a long term plan. At the same time the resorts
                            accounts payables, vendors, tour operators and guest reservations all needed to be
                            negotiated
                            with and managed. Our team pulled out all stops to satisfy the stakeholders very quickly in

                            crisis situation.

                            <p>The bank quietly gave us a mandate to find a longer term solution which was code for
                                “sell
                                this asset at the best possible price”. Skillfully, we negotiated a large settlement
                                with
                                the insurance company creating an outcome where the bank had minimal requirements to
                                continue supporting the project. The property was completely restored, the federal
                                government signed off on all environmental requirements and renewed the land lease for

                    <p class="mt-25p">A privately owned real estate company held over 100 single family homes and a
                        number of apartment complexes. Due to severe family dysfunction between those in ownership
                        positions the assets they held became incredibly neglected and so severe that environmental
                        regulators began to condemn the properties. We were brought in by their personal attorneys and a
                        court ordered mandate to fix the problems. Accounts payable were neglected, creditors were
                        calling, rental revenue was quickly declining and regulatory issues were significant. Time was
                        not on our side and the principals were also well into a contentious divorce process which added
                        an additional layer of complexity to the process.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="secodline">
                    <p>This was not a receivership but a court ordered trusteeship. We were mandated by the courts to
                        take control of the business, eliminate regulatory issues and restore the properties. Once these
                        mandates were in place and the revenue stabilized we then prepared for the sale of the assets at
                        fair market prices. Within nine months we converted all assets to cash for the courts to settle
                        between the principals.
                        <br><br> This project required us to be incredibly disciplined and focused. We were deeply
                        involved in construction oversight, waist management and environmental reclamation, regulatory
                        negotiations, vendor management, property management, banking negotiations and property sales.
                        We relied on a number of specialized internal resources and understood speed was critical. We
                        needed to tightly manage the professional costs and report to the courts on a regular basis
                        throughout the process. At the end of the day all parties were extremely satisfied although
                        during the process “fire fighting” was a daily occurrence.

                    <p class="mt-25p">This monthly publication targeted consumers interested in luxury home renovations,
                        high end appliances, interior design and furnishings. The publication was subscription based and
                        had a strong retail and news stand presence. It was majority owned by a private investor whose
                        highly successful main business was in new development marketing and support for large scale
                        developers. Although the publication was rich with high-end advertisers, prominent subscription
                        levels and a solid circulation they continued to lose money with every edition. The operators
                        who were minority shareholders continually sought further investment from the majority
                        shareholder. Managing their accounts payable became a serious issue. Their vendors and the print
                        houses were demanding upfront payment before each edition would be allowed to be published. It
                        was time for help.

                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="secodline">
                    <p>The first step was to quickly analyze the situation from within. We took a hands on approach and
                        moved fast. We reviewed and matched all AR and AP, visited with the supply chain and discretely
                        met with advertisers. Our analysis discovered that the advertising rates were inline with the
                        market and the content to advertising ratio in the publication was appropriate. The cost of
                        publishing and distribution was normal. Collections was not an issue but the add space
                        utilization against the rate cards vs deposits didn’t add up. Something was not making sense and
                        we had to look deeper. We discovered approximately 50% of the advertising revenue was converted
                        to contra. The minority shareholders were accepting goods and services for the advertising
                        space. This included leased vehicles, audio and visual systems, home furnishing and vacations.
                        It’s not until you compare tear sheets with rate cards with the physical publication and the
                        deposits that you can find the issues. The minority operators thought that contra deals were
                        simply a normal course of business given they were taking low salaries. The investor felt
                        deceived but had a long history with them so asked us to step in and mediate an exit.
                    </p>

                <div class="thirdline">
                    <div class="stakeholder">
                        <p>As with many of our projects, we had no personal relationship with the investor or the
                            operators so it was ideal for both parties to let us calmly handle the mediation. We then
                            helped source new management from within the group and put processes and controls in place
                            for the majority investor to continue with his investment confidently. Before wrapping up
                            the project we restructured the cost of operations to where it became revenue positive. We
                            then worked the phones with the companies long list of suppliers and negotiated deep
                            discounts across their significant outstanding accounts payable. Eventually the publication
                            was sold to a larger publication house and the investor was able to recover his investment
                            with a gain.

                    <p class="mt-25p">A small cap (junior) public company specializing in adult content and sexual
                        education hosting celebrities such as Dr. Ruth and other well known intimacy experts spent three
                        years developing its platform as a resource portal. At the time, this was a new idea and did not
                        involve pornography. As a junior public company, retail investors along with some institutional
                        investors were key to capital formation and the ability to raise funding. Subscriptions and
                        advertisers were equally difficult due to the stigma of the topic. As hard as they tried to
                        explain their unique product, investors were not willing to touch such a controversial stock.
                        The stock price declined in value which made raising capital even more difficult. Financial
                        obligations mounted and the Board of Directors and founders contacted us to see what could be
                        done.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="secodline">
                    <p>We could not just simply deal with the financial obligations of the company without solving the
                        fundamental issue of the content and focus of the website. We analyzed the market trends relying
                        on our key strategic relationships that deliver results. We presented the Board with a
                        comprehensive strategy which dealt with all the major issues. With the Boards consent and
                        mandate we moved quickly. Step one was to rebrand and reposition the platform into a fresh new
                        relationship and dating website. Next, we aligned the company with new market makers, PR
                        agencies and promotional companies. It was important that all major stockholders enter into a
                        selling restriction agreement allowing the company to focus on improving the business and not
                        the markets. The rise in the stock was quick and sustainable. Now we could negotiate and settle
                        all historic financial obligations using a much more stable and stronger stock as currency.

                            returned to the story and the company was able to raise funding to grow the business.
                            Eventually the site was sold to one of the larger online dating developers. Investors,
                            founders, vendors, regulators, financiers and market makers ended up with a success story.
